# User Experience Designer 


### About Me
With over 15 years in IT, I design user-friendly digital products for healthcare, gaming, and entertainment. I love creating digital solutions that help patients and healthcare providers make informed decisions. I've worked on telemedicine platforms and patient portals, always focusing on user needs. I'm good at researching, designing, and prototyping. As a game enthusiast, I also create fun and engaging games using Game Maker, Buildbox, and Unity.

### UX Case Study
During my tenure at Mobileprograamin LLC, I had the opportunity to work with Reliance Industries Ltd. During this time, I worked on several mobile and kiosk machine projects, including JioTV. I was involved in the initial design phase of JioTV with three other team members. You can read more about the JioTV application and my involvement in the attached case study.
